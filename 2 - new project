In order to create a new project in Django, run the command "django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME".

Django sets up a bunch of files in order to get started with our new project (here DJANGO).

"manage.py" is the file used to able to execute commands on this Django project.

"settings.py" contains the important configuration settings for our Django application, they come loaded with a bunch of default settings but we might wanna change the setting in order to add features to our appliction or make some modifications for how our application behaves.

"urls.py" contains table of contents for our web application, that on any given application there are number of different URLs or routes you may visit. For example: on Google, you may visit "/search" or "/images". And this file will contain all the URLs on my web application that I can ultimately visit.

A web server "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" is where my web application is currently and "127.0.0.1" is an IP address which refers to my local computer, so we can only access it exclusively on this computer and "8000" is the port number which refers to the type of service is being run.

When we click on "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" where django's default page works. Now we can actually start to begin building this web application by adding the features we want to it.

Every Django project is structured in a way that it consists of one or more Django applications. Therefore, one project may have multiple applications within it.

A big website or a big project has multiple apps that are sort of separate services that operate within it.

For example: Google has Google Search, Google Images, Google News, Google Maps, etc. which each is individually a separate app all under one larger project (here Google).

To start an app in a new project, write "python manage.py startapp APP_NAME" in command prompt.
