Django gets more interesting when we delve into the world of data and trying to have web applications that store data inside of a database.

SQL is a database language that we use to interact with databases and Django is going to allow us to have an abstraction layer on top of SQL.

To interact by not writing direct SQL queries but by interacting with Python classes and objects known as "models".

"Migrations" are going to be a technique that are going to allow us to update our database in response to changes that we make to our underlying models.

"Data" can be stored in various ways inside a computer system but generally in databases particularly (relational databases), we are going to store data inside a table where each table consists of rows and columns. Here, we are going to construct a database and a web application that an airline may use.
