First we create a new app called "tasks" and follow all the steps initially followed after we create an app.

Now we want to render a page that displays a list of all of the tasks.

First we create a global variable called "tasks" containing random tasks.

Now inside the function we have the key "tasks" that contains the variable "task" so we can use it when django is rendering it.

Instead of just being static value now it is dynamic.
